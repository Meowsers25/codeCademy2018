-A markup language is a computer language that defines the          structure and presentation of raw text.

-In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in    HTML elements.

-HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides  access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks.

-HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the         webpage and define its content. 

-A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element.

-HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML   document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

-HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and      closing (>) angle bracket.

-Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element.    The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

-Content — The information (text or other elements) contained       between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

-Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element.     Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly     after the left angle bracket.

-One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the      body element. Only content inside the opening and closing body     tags can be displayed to the screen.

-When an element is contained inside another element, it is         considered the child of that element. The child element is said    to be nested inside of the parent element.

-The relationship between elements and their ancestor and           descendent elements is known as hierarchy.

-Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements   can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element.
